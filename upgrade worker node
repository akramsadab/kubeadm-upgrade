Upgrade All Kubernetes Components on the Worker Node
Drain the worker1 node: kubectl drain acgk8s-worker1 --ignore-daemonsets
SSH into the node: ssh acgk8s-worker1
Install a new version of kubeadm:
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y --allow-change-held-packages kubeadm=1.19.2-00
Upgrade the node: sudo kubeadm upgrade node
Upgrade kubelet and kubectl: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y --allow-change-held-packages kubelet=1.19.2-00 kubectl=1.19.2-00

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart kubelet

Type exit to exit the node.
Uncordon the node: kubectl uncordon acgk8s-worker1
Repeat the process above for acgk8s-worker2 to upgrade the other worker node.
